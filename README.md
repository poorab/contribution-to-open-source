simple 8 ways to contribute in open source even if you are not a programmer.

A general concept about open source goes as open source is all about code and commits. But that's not the case all the time. Code is definitely the most important part and it's the aspect which has direct impact on users of an open source project. But that's not the only way one can contribute to an open source project. Projects are developed in an ecosystem, which means there are much more things than just a code. Here are eight other ways how you can contribute to an open source project:

1. Report issues: 

Issues should be known by the maintainers of a project in order to fix them. It's important that whenever you find any issue, don't abandon using the project, instead report the problem. Project developers are mostly happy to receive issue reports. Write a good issue report investing substantial time. If possible give the code so that the issue can be reproduced and you can also share information about expected outcome and the actual one. Share information about system, version and other similar things. Issues are not always bugs, they can also be your expectations for further improvements. You are also given contribution points by GitHub if your issues are actually opened.

2. Join a mailing list: 

You can join a mailing list as mailing list;s are the main medium of communication to track the development of a project. If a project is large enough, then there are several options of mailing lists to choose from. For example, PostgreSQL project has around 12 user-oriented lists and six developer lists on its mailing page. If you use the user-oriented list and the core developer list then you will be feeling that you are a part of the project team.

3. Diagnose a bug and if possible close it: 

An open source project's heart is in its code. Writing a code is important, no doubt, but maintaining that code is equally important. This maintenance part is often ignored to create new features and fix bugs. You can contribute to this part to get your footprint on the project. Most projects have a publicly visible trouble ticket system which includes the project website and its documentation. Always keep it updated to help the project. You may need special permissions to access the ticketing system.

4. Write documentation: 

Documentation is very important but there is lack of the same often. People usually don't enjoy writing documentation but you can adopt this way to help a project out and make it easier for other people and end-users. If there is already a documentation that is not simple enough, you can also improve it so that the person next to you might find it easier than before.

5. Improve the website: 

Open source projects have their own websites sometimes. But information on these websites are not updated always and the design is also not attractive enough. You can make it look nice and more presentable. It would be a great contribution on your part.

6. Trying out preview versions: 

Developers of a project require feedback to see if their created software is actually useful or not. That's why alpha, preview and release candidates are introduced in stipulated times. You can grab any of them and try it out personally. If you find everything perfectly alright then it's great but if you find any drawback or limitation, you should report them as soon as possible, thus helping out the project.

7. Answer questions: 

Several questions are raised about a project, try to answer them. If you answer to people's queries, then you make sure that users are getting better experience with the project overall. A question can also hint at some hidden problem with the project. Questions may indicate that improvements are required in documentation part or any other section. So find answers to such questions and if you don't find one, be sure that there is some genuine problem which needs to be addressed by any means.

8. Give a presentation about a project: 

Open source projects are usually great but developers are not very fond of making presentations about the same. If you like a project and you want to talk about it and share your views about it at any community or a conference, go ahead. It means you have adopted the project more actively and effectively. People feel more interested in the project as it looks more stable with a public presentation.
